The Ferguson Act of 1898 granted Sections 16 and 36 to the state “for the support of common schools”, but, recognizing that schools alone were not enough to guarantee the establishment of a civil society on an “equal footing” with established states, the Ferguson Act also provided for other “quantity grants” for public buildings, a university, an agricultural college, and for certain internal improvements.
