Source data for the HCN investigation, "Land-Grab Universities"

This repository contains the “Morrill Act of 1862 Indigenous Land Parcels Database.”

The database is the result of a High Country News investigation that has located more than 99% of all acres distributed through the Morrill Act of 1862 (or in lieu thereof), identified their original, Indigenous inhabitants and care-takers, and researched the principal raised from their sale in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The database reconstructs approximately 10.7 million acres taken from nearly 250 tribes, bands, and communities through over 160 violence- backed land cessions.

This unique database was created through research into primary source materials including land patent records, congressional documents, historical bulletins, archival and print resources at the National Archives, state repositories, and special collections at universities, digitized historical maps and more. Information for the database was extracted programmatically where possible, primarily from the Bureau of Land Management’s General Land Office Database, but in some cases it was transcribed manually from print records, microfilm and microfiche reproductions, or poor quality digital images.
